Introduction
-------------

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages on earth and is used to add interactivity to webpages, process data, 
as well as create various applications (mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and more).

Your First JavaScript

Let's start with adding JavaScript to a webpage.
JavaScript on the web lives inside the HTML document. 
In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags:
<script>
   ...
</script>

JavaScript can be placed in the HTML page's <body> and <head> sections.
In the example below, we placed it within the <body> tag.
EX:
<html>
    <head></head>
<body>
      <script>
         ...
      </script>
</body>
</html>

Let's use JavaScript to print "Hello World" to the browser.
<html>
   <head> </head>
   <body>
     <script>
       document.write("Hello World!");
     </script>
   </body>
</html> 
Try It Yourself

The document.write() function writes a string into our HTML document. This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. 

Formatting Text
------------------
Just like in HTML, we can use HTML tags to format text in JavaScript.
For example, we can output the text as a heading.
<html>
   <head> </head>
   <body>
     <script>
       document.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
     </script>
   </body>
</html>

JavaScript in <head>

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Typically, the script tag is placed in the head of the HTML document:
<html>
   <head>
     <script>
     </script>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
</html> 

JavaScript in <body>

Alternatively, include the JavaScript in the <body> tag.
<html>
   <head> </head>
   <body>
     <script>
     </script>
   </body>
</html>

The <script> Tag

The <script> tag can take two attributes, language and type, which specify the script's type:
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">

</script>

The language attribute is deprecated, and should not be used.

In the example below, we created an alert box inside the script tag, using the alert() function.
<html>
   <head>
     <title></title>
     <script type="text/javascript">
       alert("This is an alert box!");
     </script>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
</html>

alert("This is an alert box!"); //con esto aparecera un recuadro con un bot√≥n y el contenido de alert

External JavaScript

Scripts can also be placed in external files.
External scripts are useful and practical when the same code is used in a number of different web pages.
JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

Below, we've created a new text file, and called it demo.js.

External JavaScript

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of the <script> tag.

Here is an example:
<html>
   <head>
     <title> </title>
     <script src="demo.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
</html>

Your demo.js file includes the following JavaScript:
alert("This is an alert box!");

Importante: External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
Code after a double slash //, or between /* and */, is treated as a comment.
Comments are ignored, and are not executed.

Single line comments use double slashes.
<script>
   // This is a single line comment
   alert("This is an alert box!");
</script>
Multiple-Line Comments

Everything you write between /*and */ will be considered as a multi-line comment.

Here is an example.
<script>
   /* This code 
   creates an 
   alert box */
   alert("This is an alert box!");
</script>
